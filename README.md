#MEMZEEZ APP#


Purpose:  For the storage and commemoration of special moments and of loved ones.


---------------------------

##KEY GEMS USED##

###Carrierwave gem###
 - Handles uploading of photos by merging gem's models to your app models and for easy access of images within your views.  
 - Also allows choosing between thumbnail, medium and large size images.

###AWS-SDK gem###
- Handles physical storage of photos on Amazon's S3 'buckets'.  
- Generates URL location of photos to be saved into Carrierwave image models.

####Animations
Written in Javascript using jQuery for carousel effects of images and captions.

####Photo Upload Forms
Used nested form in ERB to upload multiple photos and captions in one page view.

###KEY LEARNINGS###
* JS Frameworks would have been wonderful to use instead of Rails for this particular app. Backbone, Ember, Angular...will have to learn these frameworks and re-create.
